## Introduction

InternEvo is an open-sourced lightweight training framework aims to support model pre-training without the need for extensive dependencies. With a single codebase, it supports pre-training on large-scale clusters with thousands of GPUs, and fine-tuning on a single GPU while achieving remarkable performance optimizations. InternEvo achieves nearly 90% acceleration efficiency during training on 1024 GPUs.

Based on the InternEvo training framework, we are continually releasing a variety of large language models, including the InternLM-7B series and InternLM-20B series, which significantly outperform numerous renowned open-source LLMs such as LLaMA and other leading models in the field.


## Quick Start

Please refer to [Usage Tutorial](./doc/en/usage.md) to start InternEvo installation, data processing, pre-training and fine-tuning.

For more details, please check [internevo.readthedocs.io](https://internevo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## System Architecture

Please refer to the [System Architecture document](./doc/en/structure.md) for architecture details.

## Performance

InternEvo deeply integrates Flash-Attention, Apex and other high-performance model operators to improve training efficiency. By building the Hybrid Zero technique, it achieves efficient overlap of computation and communication, significantly reducing cross-node communication traffic during training. InternEvo supports expanding the 7B model from 8 GPUs to 1024 GPUs, with an acceleration efficiency of up to 90% at the thousand-GPU scale, a training throughput of over 180 TFLOPS, and an average of over 3600 tokens per GPU per second. The following table shows InternEvo's scalability test data at different configurations:

| GPU Number         | 8   | 16  | 32  | 64  | 128  | 256  | 512  | 1024  |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| TGS | 4078 | 3939 | 3919 | 3944 | 3928  | 3920  | 3835  | 3625   |
| TFLOPS  | 193 | 191  | 188  | 188  | 187   | 185   | 186   | 184    |

TGS represents the average number of tokens processed per GPU per second. For more performance test data, please refer to the [Training Performance document](./doc/en/train_performance.md) for further details.

## Contribution
