    Built on the paper and library Megablocks as described in
    https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15841. This implementation is
    strictly equivalent to standard MoE with full capacity (no
    dropped tokens). It's faster since it formulates MoE operations
    in terms of block-sparse operations to accomodate imbalanced
    assignments of tokens to experts, whereas standard MoE either
    (1) drop tokens at the cost of reduced performance or (2) set
    capacity factor to number of experts and thus waste computation
    and memory on padding.
